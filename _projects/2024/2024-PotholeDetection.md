  Responsible for pre-training and fine-tuning LLaVA on pothole datasets, as well as designing and experimenting with high-resolution ViTs, such as ViT-756 and S2 ultra-high-resolution models. Compared to LLaVA 1.5, these models achieved +3.2% and +10.1% accuracy improvements, respectively, on the pothole recognition task.
