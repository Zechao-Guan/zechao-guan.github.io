  I graduated from the <a href="https://math.seu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">School of Mathematics</a>, <a href="https://www.seu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Southeast University</a>. My research focuses on 3D computer vision, including multimodal foundation models (<strong>VLMs and VLAs for embodied intelligence</strong>), 3D generative AI (<strong>3D AIGC</strong>), and the integration of topological data analysis with machine learning.

    I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://math.seu.edu.cn/lqs_2339_en/list.htm" target="_blank">Qingshan liu</a> at the Key Laboratory of Collective Intelligence of Cyberspace, Jiangsu Province.
    Prior to this, I obtained a Bachelor of Applied Mathematics from 
    <a href="https://www.gdut.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Guangdong University of Technology</a>.

    <span style="color: #d60000;">I am looking for collaborators </span> 
    interested in 3D Computer Vision, Multimodal Foundation Models, and applying these technologies to tasks involving DiscriminationðŸ‘€, GenerationðŸ¤”, and ActionðŸ¤–.
    I believe that deep learning models can effectively leverage multimodal informationâ€”such as text, images, point clouds, and topologyâ€”to understand complex 3D spatial structures, thereby enhancing their ability for perception, reasoning, and interaction in both physical and virtual environments.
    If you are interested in collaborating, please feel free to reach out via email or WeChat.
